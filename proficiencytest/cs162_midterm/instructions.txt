For this proficiency test you will write a program that works with an array of
integers.

The file supplied.o contains binary code that can build, and display an
array. 

For this test, you will need to write the following functions in array.cpp,
add function prototypes for them to array.h and invoke the functions in
main.cpp.

- int sumOfArray(int list[], int size)	

    compute and return the sum of integers in list

- int remove(int list[], int& size, int target)	

    remove all the integers that equals .target. in the list and update the
    size of the list

For test submission, use tar to combine your files into a single bundle:

tar cvf midterm.tar array.h array.cpp main.cpp

After that, use the 'turnin' program to turnin the tar file:

turnin submit midterm.tar

(If you haven't setup your path to use turnin and haven't already configured
the professor and class then you need to use the long form:
~mike.noel/bin/turnin submit prof=mike.noel course=cs162 midterm.tar)

If you do not turn in ALL of your source files or if I'm unable to compile the
code you submit then you will receive a very low score on the final exam.

The grading criteria are:

5pts The program compiles
5pts The program runs without crashing or hanging
5pts Correctly computes the sum of integers in the list
5pts Correctly removes matching integerss

You can get partial credit so be sure to turn in whatever you have by the end
of the testing time period.
