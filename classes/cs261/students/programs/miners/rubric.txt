This is the grading rubric for the Miners programming assignment.

================
If the program fails to compile, crashes, or hangs then the program
automatically gets a 0.
================

Functionality	     5
 - output for 1000 miners matches output1000.txt 100% (including all whitespace)
 - the program runs on 1000 miners.txt in less than 1 second

Implementation	    3
  - No memory leaks or memory errors.
  - The program must use the supplied runminers.cpp file, unmodified, as the
    main driver.

Design		     8
  - Use inheritance to show the relationship between the different types of
    miners.
  - Use abstract classes for all classes that shouldn't be instatiated.
  - The output strings (e.g. "Debris scoop activated.") should each only appear
    once in the cpp files. That is, you cannot have the same string in multiple
    classes. 
  - The "id" data member should only be defined in 1 class.

Style		     4
 - each class is defined in a separate file
 - class definition and implementation are in separate files (unless a template)
 - at most 1 return path per function or method
 - No use of "break" or "continue" in a loop

Total:		    20
