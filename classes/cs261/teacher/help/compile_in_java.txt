The Java compiler is a program called javac. It should already be on your path
but if it's not you can find it in /usr/jkd/bin.

In order to compiler a java program you type:

javac MyFile.java

This will result in a file called MyFile.class

In order to run this program (assuming that it has a Main() method) you type:

java MyFile

Notice that you don't include ".class" when calling java to run a program.

You can compile multiple Java files in the same directory with one command line:

javac *.java
