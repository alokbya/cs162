Keeping your files organized will make your life much easier as you go through
your Computer Science course(s). Everyone has a different style on how they
like to keep things in order and if you have a system that works for you
already then feel free to use it. However, if you are new to Computer Science
or haven't kept your files organized in the past, following these instructions
for setting up a directory structure will make your life easier.

The basic idea is that you will have a directory for each class (e.g., cs260)
and then you'll have a subdirectory in that class directory for each type of
assignment, and then within each of those directories, a subdirectory for each
specific assignment.

The following instructions provide commands to set up this structure. 

mkdir ~/classes/cs999
cd ~/classes/cs999
mkdir labs
mkdir exams
mkdir assignments

Now, when you are ready to start a new lab, exam, or assignment, go to the
appropriate directory in your class directory and use "mkdir" to make a new
directory for that new project.
