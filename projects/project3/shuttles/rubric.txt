This is the grading rubric for the Maintenance programming assignment.

================
If the program fails to compile, crashes, or hangs then the program
automatically gets a 0.
================

Functionality	     5
 - output for assignment.txt matches assignment.txt.out 100% (including
   spelling, whitespace, and punctuation).

Implementation	    10
  - use a class to define the shuttle
  - the shuttle class has the data members as described above
  - the shuttle class has the methods as described above
  - the passengers for a shuttle are stored in an array
  - all class data members are private
  - all class definitions are in header files
  - all class implementations are in cpp files
  - use an array of shuttle objects
  - the main() function is less than 50 lines long (with proper formatting)
  - extra functions are defined with prototypes in a header file
  - extra functions are defined with implementation defined in a cpp file
  - character strings need to be represented using char arrays

Design		     3
 - class definition and implementation are in separate files
 - helper functions are implemented in separate files
 - no global variables

Style		     2
 - at most 1 return statement per function or method
 - doesn't use of "break" or "continue" in a loop

Total:		    20
