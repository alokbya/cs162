This is the grading rubric for the Logs programming assignment.

================
If the program fails to compile, crashes, or hangs then the program
automatically gets a 0.
================

Functionality	     3
 - output for full.txt matches full.output.txt 100% (including
   spelling, whitespace, and punctuation).

Implementation	    12
 - use a class to implement syslog
 - use a class to implement entries in the syslog entries array
 - the syslog class must have at least a name and entries array
 - the entries array in the syslog must be an array of objects
 - all classes that have pointer data must have a copy constructor, assignment operator, and
destructor
 - logs.cpp is unchanged
 - all strings are represented with dynamically allocated character arrays
 - no fixed sized arrays in the code you write
 - no memory leaks or errors (as reported by valgrind)

Design		     3
 - class definition and implementation are in separate files
 - helper functions are implemented in separate files
 - all class data members are private
 - no global variables

Style		     2
 - at most 1 return statement per function or method
 - doesn't use of "break" or "continue" in a loop

Total:		    20
