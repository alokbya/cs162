Bugs fixed in app.cpp
---------------------

	1.	<string.h> header file was not included in the app.cpp program. This caused a compilation error when
		calling the c-string method strcpy() in the function printMsg. By including the string.h header, this 
		problem was mitigated.
	2. 	char determineGrade(double) function prototype was spelled differently that this functions declaration
		and definition. The easiest thing to do would be to change the prototypes spelling, however, to 
		maintain proper spelling and high readability, the function's declaration and definition spelling were
		corrected. The change was from determinGrade() to determineGrade. There was only a missing 'e' in 
		determine.
	3. 	There was a semicolon at the end of the else if() statement on line 54: else if(finalAvg >= MIN_C);.
		This caused the program to treat this conditional statement as a conditional with an empty statement.
		This caused the following line of code, the assignment of 'C' to variable grade, to execute regardless
		of what the conditional statement above yielded as true or false. After the semicolon, the following 
		line of code would always run, which caused the variable grade to be assigned the character value 'C',
		no matter which truthy block the logic originally stepped into.
