Lab 2

======================================================================

The object of this lab is to become more familiar with the unix development
tools.

Step 1: Go through the gdb tutorial
(http://www.unknownroad.com/rtfm/gdbtut/gdbtoc.html).

Step 2: After completing the gdb tutorial, use a text editor and create own
gdb quick reference sheet called mygdb.txt

Step 3: Go through the makefile tutorial
(http://mrbook.org/blog/tutorials/make/).

Step 4: Fix app.cpp (in the lab files)

The file app.cpp doesn't compile or run correctly. Fix the compilation errors
and then use gdb to find the defect in the code and fix it.

Step 5: Create lab2.txt and enter all of the bugs that you fixed.

Step 6: Create a makefile to compile app.cpp

Step 7: Create a tar file with the app.cpp and lab2.txt in it. You create a tar
file like this:

tar cvf lab02.tar app.cpp lab2.txt

After running this command you will see lab02.tar in your directory.

Step 7: Use turnin to submit lab02.tar.
