Lab 05

======================================================================

The comments in app05.cpp ask you to make changes. The goal is to create a
program that produces the exact same output as the "solution_app" program that
comes with the lab05 instructions.

Edit app05.cpp to make the changes that you need to make then you can build your
app by running make with the provided makefile.

Once you have your program generating the correct output, use valgrind to
check for memory leaks:

  valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full executable-file

For lab05 submission, using turnin to turning app05.cpp.
